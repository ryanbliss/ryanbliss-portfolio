  <h1>What is the COVID-19 vs. Allergy Symptoms Quiz?</h1>
  <p>As a project for Pollen Sense, I designed + developed a COVID-19 symptom quiz, based off of research done by the CDC, WHO, American College of Allergy, and Asthma and Immunology. After inputting symptoms experienced by the user, they are presented with a ranked list of illnesses most closely matching their symptoms (asthma, flu, cold, or COVID-19).</p>
  <p>The idea for this came after many Pollen Wise users were struggling to identify COVID-19 symptoms, since there are some overlapping symptoms (i.e. dry cough). The goal of the quiz was to help clarify the differences, and help people with allergies understand when they should pursue a COVID-19 test.</p>
  <p>Since it was released, the quiz has been taken by thousands of people, and is still being used and shared to this day. While I don't know the exact number, I do know that it has helped several people identify their COVID-19 symptoms and pursue testing/treatment.</p>
  <p>The quiz was designed in Figma and developed in Vue.js. Success metrics and analytics are tracked using Mixpanel.</p>
  <p>You can take the quiz <a href="https://quiz.pollenwise.com/quiz/46dea0f4-4998-4051-af9b-27c963c7b57b">here</a>.</p>
