  <h1>What is Flipbook?</h1>
  <p>As a fun side project over a Christmas vacation, I built Flipbook — a way to turn a photo collection into a GIF-style image. It aimed to combine the simple UX of Snapchat Stories with a childhood favorite — a flip book.</p>
  <p>The idea came to me in a random dream, and since I had some free time over a Christmas break, I thought it would be a good opportunity to experiment with Flutter and Firebase Realtime Databases.</p>
  <p>Designed and built in under a week, Flipbook is available on iOS <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flipbook-photo-story-books/id1493150137">here</a>.</p>
