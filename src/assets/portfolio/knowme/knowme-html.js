  <h1>What is KnowMe?</h1>
  <p>KnowMe aims to consolidate vast digital footprints into a private social network, allowing Spotify playlists to exist in the same journal entry as your Instagram Photos. They are a small startup based in Utah.</p>
  <p>While I am contractually limited in what I can say, during our short engagement I helped them design and code the foundation of their iOS app â€” which is still actively in development.</p>
