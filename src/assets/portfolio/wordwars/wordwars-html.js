  <h1>What is Wordwars.io?</h1>
  <p>What happens when you combine Scrabble with Battle Royale? Parachute down to any spot on the board and play words as fast as you can. Join words with opposing tiles to steal them; if you have no tiles left in play, you lose!</p>
  <p>To download the app on iOS, click <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordwars-io/id1448429683">here</a>.</p>
  <h1>What was my role?</h1>
  <p>Because I was the only person working on the game, I did everything, from game design to development. While I've dabbled in Unity development in the past, this was my first and only Unity game published to the App Store.</p>
  <p>The idea for the game came while I was building another game called Dimensions Royale, another Battle Royale game for mobile devices. It was a fun project, but while playing Words With Friends, the idea for this game popped into my head. My friends and family thought it was a cool idea, and when I started play testing an early prototype with my girlfriend, we were hooked. </p>
  <p>When the game was complete, I sent the game to hyper-casual game publishers, and we collaborated on a series of retention tests. For each test, the publisher would encourage me to experiment with changes that they thought might help improve retention (i.e. decreasing the difficulty of the NPC bots players were going against, parachuting down to a starting position rather than hard-coded starting spots, etc.).</p>
  <p>Working with game publishers was a cool experience, though unfortunately the acquisition costs proved higher than the publishers I was working with were comfortable with, so we dropped the project. That said, I still use some of the retention-testing principles they taught me, which has been really helpful on other projects.</p>
  <p>While I haven't tried making any games since, I'm really proud of the end result of Wordwars.io. The game was polished, and in my totally unbiased opinion, pretty fun! </p>
