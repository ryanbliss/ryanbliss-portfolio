  <h1>What is Taxzilla?</h1>
  <p>The Taxzilla mobile was a companion to their web app — a web portal connecting independent contractors to accountants — allowing users to take photos of receipts to instantly log expenses, talk to their accountant, and more.</p>
  <p>While I theoretically worked as a product manager for a small-UX agency called <a href="https://www.useable.com/">Useable</a>, the CEO of Useable ran both companies — Useable was an equity partner in Taxzilla, and performed all of the  design and development for the apps. My responsibility was to product manage thee iOS and Android developers building the mobile app, as well as design the user experience.</p>
  <p>The app is no longer available, but there is an archive page that can be found <a href="https://appadvice.com/app/taxzilla/1268855183">here</a>.</p>
