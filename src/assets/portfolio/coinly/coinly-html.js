  <h1>What is Coinly?</h1>
  <p>In 2017, I developed Coinly, a cryptocurrency profit/loss tracker that integrated with Coinbase. Pulling in your transaction history, Coinly used the weighted-average accounting method to calculate the gain or loss on your current holdings.</p>
  <p>The app was beloved by its several thousand users, who loved its minimalism and easy-to-use UX. While Facebook and Google were still allowing digital-currency related product advertisements, the app was growing 200% monthly at extremely low user-acquisition costs.</p>
  <p>The app utilized custom-built usability tools, in tandem with other tools like Firebase, to capture feedback and encourage app reviews. It has an 4.6-star rating on the App Store.</p>
  <p>The app was built using Swift, and can be downloaded for free on iOS <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coinly/id1271233323">here</a>.</p>
