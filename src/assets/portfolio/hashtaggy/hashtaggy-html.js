  <h1>What is Hashtaggy?</h1>
  <p>During college, despite having no credible experience, I co-founded Hashtaggy â€” a social media app aimed at helping people organize + find casual hangouts on campus. Users followed hashtags representing their interests (i.e. #basketball), then recommending events and casual hangouts with likeminded people. The app reached over 1,000 users at our school and raised over $40,000.</p>
  <p>While no longer available, Hashtaggy was available on iOS and Android for free. The apps were natively developed, with me helping develop the iOS app using Swift. The backend was developed in Node, using MySQL for our database layer.</p>
  <p>It was my first significant experience managing, designing, and developing a product. While I had been studying finance in college, this experience helped me discover my passion for UX and product management. The app isn't close to my best work, but it was the greatest learning experience of my life and I owe a lot to this project.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, Hashtaggy had a hard time retaining users, and after two and a half years, we decided to shut it down to pursue other ideas. </p>
