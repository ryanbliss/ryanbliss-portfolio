  <h1>What is Soar?</h1>
  <p>From the founder of Ancestry.com, Soar is a platform for coaches and trainers various business needs. For example, if a CEO wanted to hire a professional leadership coach to hold a workshop for their leadership team, you could search for top-rated ones on their website. For coaches, there is a web portal for managing their public profile, sending invoices, and more.</p>

  <h1>What was my role?</h1>
  <p>As their UX consultant, I worked closely with their users to identify pain points, prototype ideas, and ship solutions. I also helped with managing their product team, which included overseas teams in Brazil and Ukraine.</p>
  <p>Based on business requirements and customer needs, we iterated on the user experience of key initiatives, using Sketch and InVision to create interactive prototypes. Once accepted, prototypes were made into higher fidelity mockups, before creating detailed PRD documents and LucidChart system diagrams â€” either written by me or another product manager. Assets were exported to Zeplin and InVision, which the developers used in tandem with the PRDs.</p>
  <p>While I tried to avoid it, there were also times where I helped with development on certain projects, especially when high-priority bugs arose on the React app while the overseas developers weren't available (usually due to time-zone conflicts). </p>
